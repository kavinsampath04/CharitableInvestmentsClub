As of today, our club has made around 40 dollars, which is definitely a major milestone for us. We all spent some time celebrating but then got back to work as it is important that we not get complacent during a time in which the market is so volatile. Today was another research day in which we created a watchlist and had each club member suggest a stock to look into. Earnings are about to come out for a group of companies, and we looked into those some of those as potential buys. The main topics of discussion were Starbucks, Square, eBay, Microsoft, and Tencent. Our watchlist was split up into stocks that we would buy before the respective company's earnings or after. Finally, each club member received one stock that they would research and watch in the coming week. This will help us in making decisions on what stocks to buy. Those were the events of today's meeting, and this next week will be very important!
