There was no meeting today, but we did hit a major milestone. Today we hit 500 dollars in profit! This was mostly thanks to the BABA and Walmart calls, each of which went up by around 30 percent. At the moment, the account is boasting a 20 percent growth, which is double or almost triple what most people would consider average growth. We have come a long way from the MGM fiasco, and it feels good to be in profit and ready to donate. 
 
The best part about this is that we did this by ourselves. There were no parents involved, no cheating, no magic, no luck, just solid investments on our part. This goes to show that with proper knowledge of the market, anyone can make money. The stock market doesn't care too much if you are rich or middle class or ever poor. If you make the right investment at the right time, then you will be rewarded no matter what. As Nelson Mandela once said, "remember to celebrate your milestones as you prepare for the road ahead".

That is exactly what we plan on doing. We are happy about this milestone and now we are ready to make our first donation.
