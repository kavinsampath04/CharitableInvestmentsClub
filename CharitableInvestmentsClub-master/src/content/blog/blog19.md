Earnings are coming up so we need to be prepared, and that is exactly what we did today. We looked at the companies that were having earnings this week and which companies' stocks we could buy in order to make a profit. It was also important to know if we were going to buy the stock before they released their earnings or after it. Both options are valid in different scenarios. For example, if a company has bad earnings, and someone predicts this to be the case, then they can buy before and ride the hype train. Then, as soon as the company releases earnings, the person can sell the stock and enjoy whatever money they earned. On the other hand, if someone predicts that earnings are likely to be good for a company, then they could buy right before or after the company releases their earnings. This allows them to capitalize on the company's good earnings. 

We organized the stocks by when their respective company was releasing earnings on a spreadsheet. 

Here is the link to the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wLZDATHNoKyc1xfgH-t-Rvov5TvpNGnOpCW2WQRTaUo/edit?usp=sharing

The TLDR of it is that we know when to buy a respective company's stock in order to make the most profit. The way we know this is by looking at what each company does for their business. A good example of this is Ranger Energy Services RNGR. It is a relatively little known company but they specialize in energy services. Currently, the world is wrapped up in a pandemic, which means that people are going to be inside their houses and are going to consume a lot of energy. This is good for RNGR and for whoever buys the stock. However, RNGR deals with oil, which at present is performing in a less than ideal fashion. This could sway their earnings, which is why RNGR should be bought right after earnings so that we can see how they were before making our decision. 

That is just one example of how we are going to do things this week and hopefully we will be able to come out with a profit.
