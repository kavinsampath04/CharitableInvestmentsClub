The big deal today for our club was that we purchased our first option! We used what we learned in the last meeting to guide us to make a solid decision on buying an option. BABA (Alibaba) was the company that we bought the option for and we believe that it will make us a lot of money as BABA is considered to be the Amazon of China. China is a big market and if BABA mirrors Amazon's exponential growth, then this could be a very good investment for us. 

What further aided us in making our decision was analyst recommendations from various sources (CNBC, Finance.yahoo, etc.). Almost all of the analysts were saying that Alibaba would be a good buy at the moment. So, by seeing all of these people recommend it, we just had to invest. Looking at analyst recommendations is a small but important step in the investment process as two pairs of eyes are always better than one, especially when that second pair of eyes is someone whose job is to invest in the market. 

With all of that thought put into making this momentous decision, we hope the rewards are just as momentous.
