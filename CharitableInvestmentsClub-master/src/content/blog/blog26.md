Walmart's stock fell today so we thought it would be a good time to buy a call option. The reasoning behind this was that Walmart is an extremely large and stable company, so the stock was bound to go back up. Lo and behold, the stock went back up and we make around a 33 percent gain on our call. 

No meeting was required to make this decision, we all just took a vote on it via Slack. Our knowledge coupled with the quickness of our response led to us making big gains for the account today. We hope this growth continues because it could mean good things for our impact on our community.
