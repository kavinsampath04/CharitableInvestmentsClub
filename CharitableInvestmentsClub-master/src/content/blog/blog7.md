The market went down significantly. Our account was in the negative. This is a tough time, but we understood that we should not panic and that in time, the companies that we have invested in will rebound. We learned about something related to our loss: realized vs. unrealized. It is a concept in the stock market in which once an account takes a loss, it is only called realized once the owner of the account sells that stock. Otherwise, it is considered an unrealized loss, meaning that the stock could go back up. We have unrealized losses because we are going to hold on to our stocks and see if they go up. The companies that we have invested in are good and reliable, and we all believe that they will make us money in the future.
