We had our official club meeting today and we delegated the tasks to each team (analyst, donations, and marketing). Other than that, not much has been going on and we have continued to work on the Wharton Business Competition. To be honest, many people have not done enough work and that may cost us in the long run. The mid term report is due on November 2, and no one has talked about it yet. Anyway, we have to get through that and get to work, which we will soon.
