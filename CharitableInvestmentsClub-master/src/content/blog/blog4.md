We were all excited to learn that today, our account had made around twenty dollars! It may seem like a little, but to us, it is a big deal because it shows that our first investment as a club is a success. Moreover, we talked about potential buys for the club. Snapchat, Raytheon, Jetblue, and Microsoft were all some of the companies that were discussed. No final decisions were made, as we did not want to be too risky with our buys. The main discussion for the day was the slack stock. Slack is a company that specializes in online meetings for the corporate world. Due to the coronavirus, we figured that more people would be working from home, so they would be using slack's software. This stock is something we are all looking at very closely and may buy a few shares soon. Overall, today was a day for more research and seeing how much our portfolio had grown.
