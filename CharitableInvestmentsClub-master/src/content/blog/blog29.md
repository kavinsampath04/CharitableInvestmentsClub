Today was the big day! We presented to 18 kids who we picked to join our club. The presentation went well and we had an excellent turnout (18/21). This is just the beginning, but what a beginning it is!

The meeting took place at 5:00 pm and it was over zoom. We screen shared a slide show and presented for around 30 minutes and then took questions. To our surprise, there were no questions, which must mean that we did a good job of presenting. Everyone seems to be onboard with the club and most of the new members have signed the volunteer consent form. The form is nothing too serious, it just states that the members will be volunteers for our non profit.

We will be beginning the curriculum in September, and it will last for the whole month. After that, we are planning to do some fundraising and will split the volunteers into one of three groups (fundraising, marketing, and analyst). Overall, this club is really starting to take off and will go far now that it has more members.
