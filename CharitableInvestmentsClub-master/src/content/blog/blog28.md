We had a relatively small meeting in which we simply went over the slideshow for tomorrow's presentation. We split the presentation into different parts and everyone will cover a specific aspect of the club. 

Moreover, the club sponsor may also be attending the meeting tomorrow, so we have to make sure that whatever we say is truthful and impresses him. All in all, we are all ready for tomorrow and will make sure that everyone feels proud to be a part of the Charitable Investments Club.
