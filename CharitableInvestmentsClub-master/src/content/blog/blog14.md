As we continue to wait for a proper time to sell MGM, we have now shifted our attention to becoming fiscally sponsored. What that means is that we want to become sponsored by a non-profit organization that shares a goal similar to that of ours. Eventually, once the club gets large enough, we would like to become a non profit organization ourselves, but that a few months away. For now, we are looking at how to get a fiscal sponsor and any clubs that we can draw knowledge from. One such club is the Cash Club. The club is for people to learn about stocks and does not invest real money, making it different from our club. However, they have been fiscally sponsored and are now a non profit themselves, which is our goal as well. Because of this, we reached out to them today via their instagram account and asked about who they partnered with and how they were able to become a relatively big non profit organization. 

We are still waiting for the response from the Cash Club, but we feel like communication with people that know more than we do on a subject will be beneficial in the long run. At some point, we were even considering getting fiscally sponsored by the Cash Club, but decided against it as the Cash Club is still run by high schoolers. We want a more professional organization to take our club under their wing, which is why we restrict ourselves strictly to conversation for information with the Cash Club. Nonetheless, we believe that becoming fiscally sponsored will be a momentous moment for our club and that it will propel our club into the limelight. We want this club to be something that stays at our school far after we have left, and becoming fiscally sponsored and eventually a non profit will help us achieve that goal. 

Aside from the discussions about the Cash Club, we also outlined a game plan for the next few weeks.

That plan is listed now:
    Look for non profit organizations that can fiscally sponsor us.
    Research about how to become a non profit organization (501c3 status).
    Engage in conversation with the Cash Club.
    Continue to look for potential stocks to buy once we sell MGM (hopefully by early July.
    Look for other opportunities to benefit the community (like buying masks for doctors on the      front line).
    Finish the club website.
    Look for places in which this blog can be posted to garner awareness for our club.
