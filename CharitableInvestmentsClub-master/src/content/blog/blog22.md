Today we talked about two investing terms: calls and puts. It was very confusing but towards the end we started to understand. Basically, a call is a contract between a person and the market. It's important to note that the contract for the call does not exist between any two people because contracts are bought and sold anonymously. 

For a call, the seller is selling one hundred shares of a stock that he or she owns. The buyer is supposed to pay a premium fee that is decided by the supply and demand in the market. Once this premium is paid, the contract is sold. In paying the premium and securing the contract, the buyer is betting that a stock will go above what is known as a "strike price". If the stock goes above this price, then the buyer of the contract can buy the hundred stocks from the seller at a cheaper price. However, if the stock does not hit the strike price within the contract's expiration date (which is predetermined by the seller), then the buyer gets nothing. 

There are a few loopholes in the system, however, as the buyer can sell the contract before it expires to avoid losing anything. Once someone buys the contract, it is their problem and the original buyer of the contract has nothing to worry about. Moreover, the price of contracts goes up the farther away their expiration date is set to. By setting abysmally high expiration dates, people can make a lot of money by selling contracts. 

As for puts, they are basically the opposite of calls. Instead of wanting the stock to go up to a certain price, the buyer wants the stock to go down to a certain price. With this in mind, it is easy to assume that on down days for a market, puts are more expensive than calls and vice versa.

Overall, while we may not fully understand calls and puts, we definitely understand them better than we did before, and that is all one can hope for.

Besides increasing our knowledge on market options, we also discussed the intricacies of becoming a non profit. In the coming weeks, we will have to write legally binding contracts as lawyers are too expensive for the task and no one can truly understand how we want the contract to be structured besides us. It will be a challenge, but we are up to it as it will ensure prosperity and security for our club in the future.
