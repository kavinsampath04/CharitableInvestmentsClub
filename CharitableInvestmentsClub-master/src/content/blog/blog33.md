Today we had a small meeting in which we showed the club account to our newest members. We felt that it would serve as an important inspiration for them to pursue learning how to invest. Moreover, they were informed of the schedule for the next few months and when the training would begin (first Sunday of September).

After the meeting was over, something interesting happened. We got a text from a member of a different non profit whose name will not be mentioned because it hardly matters in the current state of things. Anyway, they were asking for a partnership in which we donate the money we make by investing to them and they give us extra volunteers and market our club. At the moment, we do not need this partnership as it does more harm that good for our club. It puts our club in an inferior position to the other club, and we all agreed that allying with the other club in this specific way is not something we want to do. 

However, we do want to keep them interested. As they say "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer". That is kind of the mindset that we would like to employ in this situation. We will attend a zoom meeting with them and will tell them that we are interested in their proposition while not giving anything away about what we are doing in the club. That way, they don't immediately right us off as we could need their assistance in the near or far future. In the corporate world, this is called "keeping them warm". Basically, we want them to think that we are considering their offer even though at present there is no way we will accept it. Later on, when we may need advertising/marketing or extra volunteers, then we will contact them. As of now, we are all on board with this approach, but there is a lot of room for change, and maybe that change will occur when we have that Zoom meeting.
