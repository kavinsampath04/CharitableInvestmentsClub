Today our account has reached around 430 dollars in profit, and we are ready to make our first donation. So, we discussed where we wanted our donation to go. At first, we were thinking about donating to the North Texas Food Bank, but after some discussion, decided against it as we feel like they aren't in as much need as some other places. 

It was because of this reason that we decided to donate it to a homeless shelter. Which one we will donate to, we don't know yet, but we will contact many and see what they require and will be sure to buy exactly that. As for where we will buy the products and how we will get them to the donation site, we have a plan for that too. 

We will buy in bulk from a wholesale retailer like Costco, Sams, or any other online company. Then, we will rent out a U Haul trailer/wagon and will haul the donation to the homeless shelter. When we get there, we will set up some tables and make it look nice. This will be a huge deal for the club as it will make us known to the public, so it is important that we do this first donation right.
