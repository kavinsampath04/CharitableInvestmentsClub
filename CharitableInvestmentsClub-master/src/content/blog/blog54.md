After a long delay, we have finally gained access to our Fidelity account. This is a huge moment for us as we will now be able to work with the analyst team to invest in the market and hopefully make a profit. Our meeting today revolved around planning the future of the club now that we have an account. If we invest properly, we may be able to attract the attention of possible donors. More donors means more publicity and money invested in the market. More money in the market means more potential gains for us to donate to charity. It's all a network effect that we most definitely want to be a part of.
