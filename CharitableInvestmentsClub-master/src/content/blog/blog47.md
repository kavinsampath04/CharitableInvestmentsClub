---Today was the weekly meeting in which we discussed each group's tasks. The analyst team will be responsible for researching stocks while the marketing team will be focusing on recruiting new members. In addition to that, the donations team will be brainstorming different companies we can reach out to for funding. Not much has been going on during this month because everyone had semester exams and after that wanted to relax over the winter break.
