Today we bought a share of Shopify, making it the most expensive stock ever bought by the account. Coming in at around 730 dollars, we bought Shopify because we saw that the stock was down and that once it recovered, we would make money. Moreover, we put in what is known as a trailing stock loss order. That simply means that there is a price that we set, and at that price the stock will sell, no matter what. This allows for more aggressive investing as someone can invest a lot of money and then put a trailing stock loss order that minimizes maximum losses that can be accrued. Aggressive investing is a model that we are looking into because it will allow us to reach our goal of hitting 300 dollars gained for charity. Besides Shopify, we also sold PINS (Pinterest), which was the first stock that we bought on the account. We recorded a gain of around 22%, making PINS our first realized gain. A realized gain is when you sell the stock, meaning that you get the money that you invested and gained back. We look forward to our journey with Shopify and hope it will be even better than the journey with PINS.
