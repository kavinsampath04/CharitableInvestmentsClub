Today we had a relatively long meeting (around one hour) where we discussed the Wharton Business Competition and finalized the press release for our club's donation. We wanted today to be a full on strategy development day, but not every member of the board was present, so we were unable to fully develop our strategy for the Wharton competition. For this reason, we will be having another meeting tomorrow at around 6 p.m.

As for the press release, it turned out pretty good. We made sure to follow a professional outline and even added the best pictures from our donation. By now, our advisor has been emailed the PR report and will be sending it out shortly. Overall, that was what occurred in today's meeting, and tomorrow's meeting will be when we fully plan out our investment strategy for the business competition.
