As of today, our month of learning has officially started! The plan is to take all of the new club members through around four meetings (each about an hour long) that will teach them all they need to know about the stock market. Today was the first meeting, and it was led by me (Aksh Tyagi) and Kavin Sampath (club founder).

The teaching process went smoothly and everyone understood the material, which is a good sign as the first week content was relatively easy. We feel like the questions will begin to come along in the later weeks of the curriculum as the topics that will be covered then will be much more complicated. However, that should not take away from our first successful delivery of our curriculum.

The first step is oftentimes the most important as it determines the direction of the next steps, and I feel like we have taken a step in the right direction with this curriculum and the way we have chosen to deliver it.
