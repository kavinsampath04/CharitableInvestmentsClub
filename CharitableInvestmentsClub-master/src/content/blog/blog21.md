Today we tried something new. Normally, our meetings have been led by Kavin (club leader), but today, he decided that from now on meetings can be led by different individuals, which we hope will help us with leadership skills for when we open the club up to new members. So, for today, Prabhav led the meeting in which we went through a few critical things for the club. On the investing side, we are still stuck because MGM is really limiting our buying options. We have decided that MGM will be a long term play and eventually it will correct itself and make us money.  

In addition to that, we discussed the many intricacies starting a school club and a company. The plan is that once school reopens in the Fall, we are going to enlist as a school club and hopefully get approved. There is no reason that we shouldn't get approved because what we are doing is very unique. Anyway, once we get approved, we will have a legal document that we will make everyone who joins sign. The purpose of this document is mainly to avoid theft of our work. We will be working hard to make a constructive curriculum so that whoever joins our club can learn about investing and make a difference in the community. Understandably, we don't want that curriculum to be stolen or copied by someone who joins our club just to copy it. 

We also had many ideas on how much people should contribute to keep the club running smoothly. The amount that was settled on was 50-100 dollars. So, the way that would work is as soon as people join the club, sign the contract, and work through the curriculum, they will have to donate from fifty to a hundred dollars. That may seem like a lot, but it is necessary in order to keep the club in a good spot to continue making investments that benefit the community. If a club member chooses not to give money, then that's perfectly fine, they can still help out with the club, but their access to the main account will be limited. 

Above all, we want this club to be a place where people can learn and make a difference while forming lifelong friendships. We will strive for this goal and will use our past experiences to get there.
