Perhaps we were too optimistic. As of now, our account is down by about 200 dollars from what it was. That is not too bad, and we understand that there will be both up and down days. If the market constantly went up, then we would be in a utopian society, which simply does not exist. 

Looking on the bright side, we are ready to make our first donation. It will be peanut butter and we will donate it to a local homeless shelter as planned. We took out around 200 dollars from our account to finance this, but that is not what contributed to the loss that our account recently took. What contributed to that was the DOW and S&P 500 dropping by a sizable proportion. Major down days is something that we can not avoid, we just have to try and make the best out of it, and we believe that making a donation now is doing just that. 

All in all, Bonaparte's wisdom still stands; "victory belongs to the persevering". And we will persevere.
