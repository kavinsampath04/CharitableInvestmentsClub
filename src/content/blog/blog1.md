Today was our second official meeting and it was a good continuation to the first one as we all learned a lot. As for our major topic of the day, we all discussed the major drop in oil, which we believed to be an effect of the coronavirus. Moreover, all of the club members presented once again their picks for good stocks to potentially buy. This created what may become a club tradition, in which each meeting, club members will all present stocks that they believe to be financially beneficial. As for the learning for today's meeting, we all learned about blue chip stocks, turnover rates, and market capitalization. The biggest topic of the three was the blue chip company, and the topic dominated our conversation. We talked about how blue chip companies are normally reliable due to their large income and market capitalization. A large income means that the company is less likely to fall into debt and their stock is more likely to be stable. Overall, today was a day of learning, and all of the club members are looking forward to the other topics they can learn about.
