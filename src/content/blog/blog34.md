"Victory belongs to the most persevering" - Napoleon Bonaparte.

Our account hit 4,000 dollars today. This is a huge milestone for us and it proves that anything can be accomplished. Even today, we were not expecting such gains, but it just happened. Sometimes it's the things that take us by surprise that truly make our day a memorable one. And even more importantly, the success we garnered was done by us and us alone. No one else had a hand in it (except maybe the market). We did it our way. 

Now, all that is left to do is look towards the future with optimistic eyes. We will make our first donation very soon and after that, we will continue to make good investments in the market. As for our donation, we are planning to donate peanut butter, which may seem non essential, but it is what the homeless shelters are asking for.

We won't dwell on the past too much, but we all know that today will be a day forever remembered.
