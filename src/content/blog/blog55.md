After a period of getting things set up, today we made our first trade as a club! We bought 5 shares of SNAP. In addition, we discussed potential call options for MSFT, AAPL, and DIS. These stocks all have good news surrounding them, and many analysts have given them positive buy ratings. After discussion, we were planning on purchasing an MSFT call option, but our Fidelity account would not let us due to some internal configuration. As such, we are waiting until next Monday, when hopefully we will be able to make the trade.
