Major milestone today. We have hit a 100 dollars in profit!!! This is very important to us all as it shows that what we are doing is right and that we can be successful in our endeavours to raise money for charity. The main driver behind this was the averaging down that we did for many of our stocks, including our most recent purchase (LABU). Averaging down allowed us to correct our mistakes and capitalize on the stock's price lowering and rising back up. Such a strategy is not only helpful in the club, but may be helpful when we all start personally trading on private accounts. Moreover, this is a big deal because we didn't just make money during a normal time for the market. No, we made money amidst coronavirus and rioting, all of which were causing the market to be very volatile/unpredictable. Nonetheless, we were able to hit the milestone of making one hundred dollars on the account, and this leaves us more excited for what is to come.
