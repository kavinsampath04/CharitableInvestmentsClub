Today was a very big milestone for our club as we made the purchase of our first stock! This month, the whole club was tasked with finding good stocks that we could use to kickstart the investing in our club. The final options were pinterest and starbucks. Pinterest looked good because they had been growing steadily in the past few years and had small liabilities with large assets. This meant that they would most likely be able to weather the storm that is coronavirus. On the other hand there was Starbucks, which was expected to reopen soon and we believed that due to the reopening, the stock would rise up. However, in the end, we decided on Pinterest because we saw more potential in it and it was a cheaper stock to purchase, coming in at around $17.50. As soon as the order was placed, our account saw a small increase, which gave us a lot of hope and excitement. We are all looking forward to seeing how Pinterest does for the Charitable Investments Club and what other stocks we can buy.
