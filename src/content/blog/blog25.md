These next few weeks are going to be difficult but as Billy Cox says: "Life's greatest difficulties always happen right before life's greatest breakthroughs." We all certainly hope this is true in our case. In today's meeting, we discussed two major topics. Number one was advertising for the club and who should join the club initially. Number two was curriculum and document planning. 

As for advertising, we have already created a social media account but we believe that just having the account will not help in the long run. We are going to have to get more personal. So, we have decided to DM (Direct Message) the people we want to be a part of the club. These people were hand picked because in our eyes they will benefit the club with their participation. 

As for the curriculum and document planning, we have made two Google Documents that will house the content of both the curriculum planning and the document drafting. We have split the curriculum into three units and have a good idea as to how long it should take to teach all of the club members (around 4 weeks). We have also planned out what will happen after the "Learning Phase" as we like to call it. What will happen after will be a "Testing Phase" in which all club members will manage an account with fake money. This phase will last for about 3 weeks and after that, the members will be split into three groups: Donations, Analysts, and Social Media/Awareness. These groups will give everyone specific jobs and we believe that specificity will lead to more productivity as there will be no question as to what someone in the club should be doing.

Finally, for the document planning. There will be two contracts that will be drafted for the use in our club. One will be a volunteer consent form in which we simply state that by signing the contract, a club member becomes a volunteer. The second one will be much more intimate. In it, we will outline all the rules of the club and certain consequences for not following said rules. It may seem tyrannical, but this contract will help keep order and trust between everyone in the club. 

It is important to note that we will not be referred to as a "club" for long. As of right now, we are working on applying to become a non profit organization, and once we secure that title, we will become a company. However, as Buddha once said:  "Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment." I think we will do just that.
