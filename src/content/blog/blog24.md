"When people throw stones at you, turn them into milestones" - Sachin Tendulkar (Indian cricketer)

In our case, the stone was MGM and the person was the market. MGM tanked our account and we thought it would never be able to recover. However, we held the stock and now it has helped us reach a major milestone. That milestone is that we are now out of loss and have fifty dollars of profit. All of this is thanks to MGM going above twenty-one dollars.
The increase in the MGM stock is due to an external company investing around one billion dollars into MGM for online gambling. Such an absurd amount of money is what caused the stock to fly up. 

MGM's rise could not have come at a better time for us because we were becoming very tied down in what stocks we could buy because a large portion of our account's money was in MGM. As of now, we have sold twenty-five shares of MGM and are now holding the remaining fifty in the hopes that MGM will continue to rally upwards. 

Another major item we decided on was to look away from tech stocks and more into stocks that are still undergoing recovery. Tech stocks were barely affected by the COVID crisis that has gripped the world and many other sectors of the economy. However, the tech sector was spared because employees at tech companies could work from home and people could use technological appliances and applications from the safety of their homes. 

Now that COVID is starting to die down, people will start to go back outside and interact with other sectors of the economy such as food and clothing. It is because of this realization that we as a club are now going to focus on stocks outside of the tech sector as we believe that will give our account the best chance for growth.
