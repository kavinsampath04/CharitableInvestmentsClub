We may be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. There was no meeting today, but our account has started to perform well once again. Our decision to buy ULTA paid off as today the stock jumped by around twenty dollars, giving our account a boost of around forty dollars. Moreover, MGM finally began to rise, giving our account another boost. Currently, the account is 200 dollars from breaking even. What this means is that we are quite close to having no losses, and without losses, we can focus on gains. We knew that MGM was risky, and it did really give us a run for our money, but it seems that it is rising once again, and with it, our account is too.

A potential reason for this is that MGM is not only a casino but it is also in the real estate business. So, as people begin to become more social through casinos and other sorts of meetings, MGM is seeing a rise. Obviously, COVID is still present, which could cause the market to go down as right now there is little backing up the market's upturn. However, MGM is a company that we believe can succeed as their growth is definitely backed by their business. Overall, we are all excited to see where our account goes from here, and we are hopeful that it will be in the green.
