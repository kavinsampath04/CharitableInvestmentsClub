Today we officially completed our organization's bylaws and we are now ready to create a bank account under the corporation's name. This is a huge step in the right direction for us as it sets us apart from many other non profit organizations that have been started by other students. In addition to this, we planned out what the next few days will look like in terms of meetings.
