We have completed the mid term report despite all of our busy schedules. There was also a club meeting today, in which we checked up on how each team was doing. They have all been getting work done, and we told them to establish a blog so that we know how much work they are doing on a weekly basis. 

As for the club account, it is not doing so well. The account has tanked to around 1600 dollars because of the state the market is currently in. However, we have a plan as to how we will get out of this hole, and we will be employing it soon with the analyst team.

Today we met up at 9 a.m in order to make some moves in the market. First, we bought two contracts for a Best Buy (BBY) call option. We believe that Best Buy will be going up because of Black Friday and the upcoming holidays. Moreover, Best Buy's online presence has grown significantly due to COVID making people stay at home. This increase makes it more likely that the stock will go up because people have already done business with the company. In addition to the BBY call, we also purchased fourteen contracts of a General Electric (GE) Call.

General Electric received good ratings from a variety of investors and firms, which caused the stock to jump recently. We believe that the stock will continue to grow because it is well positioned to hit its target price. Both of these call options are short term buys as we will be selling them in the January to March time frame.
