Today we all learned about a term that is very important in the stock market: the stop loss order. It is an order in which a stock will sell when it drops to a certain price (set by the owner of the account). It is easy to think about it as a sort of safety net. If someone has made money, then they can set a stock loss order so that they won't lose the money that they gain if the stock starts dropping. After learning this, we made an order for two stocks of Microsoft because we believed that once earnings released, Microsoft would go up. We knew this because we had researched that many people had been using Microsoft products (laptops, Microsoft Teams, etc.). Once the order was made, we moved on to our next order of business, discussing Facebook and Twitter. Facebook had been boasting large ad revenue, and we believed that both Facebook and Twitter would go up. Everyone decided that it is best to buy Twitter because it is a cheaper stock, meaning that we would be able to buy more shares. In the end, we decided to have one of us monitor the stock and then buy up Twitter once it hit $32.50.
