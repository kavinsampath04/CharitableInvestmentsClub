Relatively short meeting today. We finalized our game plan for the next few days by deciding which stocks to sell and which ones to buy. Snapchat (SNAP) was a stock that we bought recently and at present it is slightly negative. We decided that we are going to sell SNAP right before the market closes today. That way, we won't have to ride with it through earnings, which could be quite harmful to the stock seeing as ad revenue is a very volatile subject. On the topic of ad revenue, however, we may look into buying SNAP in the future because a lot of companies have been moving away from Facebook as a major platform for their ads. Big brands like Adidas, Puma, and Dunkin' are looking at Snapchat and Twitter to broadcast their business. With more companies migrating to places like SNAP, the company's ad revenue could see a major uptake, which would cause the stock to skyrocket upwards. Nevertheless, that is all just a thought, for now.

After SNAP sells at market close today, we also decided to pick up two shares of Microsoft as their earnings may be good, which would cause the stock to jump and would make our account a lot of money. Microsoft is a relatively stable company and it is part of the tech sector, which has been doing very well in light of the pandemic. People working for Microsoft mostly still have their jobs as they can work from home, which means that the company has not had to suffer during this pandemic. 

All in all, we made some solid decisions today and now all that's left to do is ride it out.

Update: Afterhours SNAP dropped over 11%, so it was good that we didn't stick with it through earnings.
