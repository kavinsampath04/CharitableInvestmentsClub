Two major things today. First, we looked at how to spread awareness for our club through the use of social media. Second, we talked about MGM, a casino stock that has caused our account to "lose" a lot of money. We believe that, while MGM may be doing bad for our account now, it will go up in the near future. Our belief is backed up by the fact that MGM is opening new casinos in early July, meaning that more people will engage in gambling, leading to a larger revenue and stock valuation. Our goal is to sell MGM when it hits 26 dollars because we understand how unpredictable casino stocks are right now due to COVID. 

For now, we can't really look at buying stocks because we have a hefty 75 shares put into MGM. However, once MGM hits 26 dollars, we will sell it and immediately invest our money into some other stock that we believe will help in achieving our goal of making 300 dollars. The situation we are in is nicely summarized by the following statement: we are not necessarily losing money, we are just losing time. This is true because we believe that we will be able to make some money with MGM, but that it will take a while before the stock rises. In the meantime, we can not invest into a stock that could perhaps give us gains, which is why we are losing time and not money. Nonetheless, we have learned more about trailing stop loss orders through our experience with MGM. That lesson is that we should put tight stop loss orders when we buy to minimize losses and so that they execute relatively quickly so we can immediately invest our money into some other stocks. 

As for the raising awareness part of our meeting, we created an Instagram account and made our first post. This post introduced the club and our goal and will be a good way for people to understand what we do. Moreover, we began to plan for how we could gain awareness in our community. A good idea that we are likely to pursue is the donation of masks to nearby hospitals as they continue to fight the COVID crisis. We have made some money from the account, so we are going to use around forty dollars of our profits to buy 100 medical masks from Amazon. Then we are going to give these masks to local hospitals, and in doing so will give the community a glimpse of what this club is about and what good it is capable of doing.
