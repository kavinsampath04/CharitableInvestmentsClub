As the world continues to navigate through the coronavirus crisis, we as the Charitable Investments Club decided to continue in our efforts to benefit the community. Today we held a meeting in which we discussed how to help in our community, when and how to invest, and what our website should look like. Firstly, and most importantly, we went in depth on things that we could do to better the community. Everyone in the club had a strong desire to volunteer, and we looked at emailing organizations that could allow us to help them. One of our club members was affiliated with an organization (HOSPIS) that was responsible for treating sick patients. We decided to let him reach out to them and eagerly wait for their response. After talking about that, we turned our attention to investing. Everyone in the club agreed that a lot of research and preparation would be required in order to invest successfully during a time in which the market is in such turmoil. As a result of this, the club made the decision to begin investing at the next weekly meeting. In the meantime, we were all to do research on potential good stocks for the club to invest in. Finally, we talked about how our club website was going to look. A lot of good ideas were pitched, and we were able to finalize a list of things that we wanted to be on our website. Today was an important day for the club as we laid the groundwork for what is to come.
