The start of this week was a rough one as our account went down a lot due to pinterest, amd, and twitter all falling. However, we were determined to make the account go back up, so we used the practice of averaging down to make that happen. When the stock went down, we bought more of it in hopes that it would go up and that we would be able to make a profit. Our research and timing with the investment paid off and we were able to bring our account out of the negatives and into the positives. This was our first real test when it came to our experience with the stock market, and we were able to pass it. A major takeaway from this is that for our future investments, we shouldn't panic if our account goes down, we should try to use strategies like averaging down to make our account go up.
