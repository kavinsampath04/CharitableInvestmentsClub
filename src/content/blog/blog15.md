Our account isn't doing so great at the moment. At today's market close, the account had hit 1800 dollars. Our main problem is coming from MGM because we have 75 shares of it and it has tanked in the last couple of weeks. This is probably due to COVID still being very prevalent in many major cities across the country. However, we all decided today that we would continue to wait on selling MGM because we still believe the stock can go up as the people will eventually start going back to casinos. Moreover, MGM also has big holdings in real estate, so we believe that the stock will go up as the company is able to get back into business. 

To combat the maladies our account is suffering through, we decided that we would inject more money into the account so that we can buy more stocks while we wait for the right time to sell MGM. Our account will receive around 500 to a 1000 dollars from another account, and we believe that this amount will help our account stay afloat as we try to bring the account's evaluation up. 
Besides that, we are discussing ordering masks for our raising awareness project that we discussed in meetings prior. The masks will help us let the community know that we are here to help. All in all, our account is going through some tough times, but we are not going to let that stop us.
