Today we met with our club teams (donations, marketing, and analyst) separately and told them about their roles and responsibilities within the club. We all agreed that the meetings should be separate because it will warrant higher attendance and attention. Just as we expected, almost everyone attended and we feel like they are all on board with what they will be doing in the next few months. 

As for the Wharton Investment Competition, we will be having a meeting about that tomorrow in which we will formulate a short term investment strategy for our client. Our long term strategy is looking good and if we can make a strong short term strategy, then our team will have a good outlook in this competition.
