Two events occurred today, we had our scheduled team meetings and had an introductory meeting with the new recruits. We will be bringing in ten new people into CIC, and we are excited to see what we can do together. As for the team meetings, we just checked on whether the teams completed their tasks, and they did so they will now be moving on to the next task.
