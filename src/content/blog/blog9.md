Today was our first meeting in a few weeks because we were all busy studying for our AP exams. Now with that out of the way, today we met to discuss future buys for our account. There were two main stocks that we viewed: Shopify and LABU (ETF). Everyone decided to not buy Shopify right away and instead voted to monitor it for the next few days. As for LABU, we purchased 6 shares of it because we believe that it will go up either tomorrow or in the next few days. LABU is intended to be a short term investment in which we make around 20 - 30 dollars and then pull out with the money. Now is a good time for biotech, as they are manufacturing coronavirus vaccines, which is giving them a lot of attention and money. Due to those reasons, we invested in LABU today.
