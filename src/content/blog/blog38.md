For this whole month, we have all been invested in the training of our recruits. As a result, we did not have too many board meetings. However, the month was still eventful for us. We will be donating the two hundred pounds of peanut butter to the North Texas Foodbank tomorrow (Thursday) at around 3:50 p.m. Moreover, we have been registered for the Wharton Business Competition and Mr. Simpson is our advisor. He teaches a marketing/finance course, which makes him a perfect advisor for us in this competition.

The Wharton Business Competition will require a lot of work, and I personally have done some research which I will summarize here. Basically, there are teams of 4 - 6 people that have to invest 100,000 virtual dollars. The investing will be done through the Wharton Investment Simulator, and the teams will be investing for a client. The information on the client will be presented to us in the form of a portfolio of sorts. We as a team have to look at this portfolio and have to design a cohesive investment strategy for the client. Once the strategy is developed (we plan on developing ours this weekend), we will use it to invest in the simulated environment. If we make gains using the strategy, then that's good, but the true way to win in this competition is the uniqueness of the strategy and the way in which it is presented. 
All in all, we are all very excited to be a part of this competition and are going for the top spot!
