Our account is still down, but now we have a plan. For the past few days, we have been working together to secure a loan of money from another account. We put around 700 extra dollars into our account to combat the effects MGM was having on it. At the moment, our account balance is at around $2,400. With the extra money, the goal of the account has now become reaching $3,000. This may seem like a lot, but all of our investments have been lucrative, with the exception of MGM. If MGM recovers, and it definitely will, our account will skyrocket. To aid with the recovery, we decided to use the extra money in order to purchase another stock. We bought ULTA today at around $195. ULTA is a beauty products company and seeing since people are still using makeup everyday, we believe it to be a good buy. We bought two stocks of ULTA, leaving the account with around 400 dollars in liquid cash. Despite the adversity our account is facing, we now have a plan to put our account in the green.
