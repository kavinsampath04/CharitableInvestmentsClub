In today's meeting, we talked about future plans and navigating through this busy part of the year. We gave out tasks to each board member. These tasks included finishing the website, starting the development of a CIC Bullseye strategy for investing, and uploading more on Instagram. These tasks will be completed by the end of next week and we will be investing by that time as well. If our stock picks are right, we plan on donating in May and then again after summer.
