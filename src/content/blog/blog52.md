The weekly meetings have been going as planned, and we are now into our fundraising phase. We have set up a PayPal account and have all of the paperwork set so that all donors will receive a tax exempt status for their donation. Today we also discussed the creation of our club video, which we will use to market our club to companies. Finally, we set up a meeting time (Saturday at 10 a.m.) so that we can meet and plan for the future of the club.
