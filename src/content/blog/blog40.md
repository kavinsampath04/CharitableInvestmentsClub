It's been a while. Not because we haven't been working, and not because I haven't wanted to update the blog, but just because a lot of work has been piling up around everyone. Anyway, these few past weeks have been eventful and we have gotten a lot done. First of all, the club members are now almost fully initiated and they will begin fundraising/analyzing stocks/marketing soon. 
As for the Wharton Business Competition, we made our first two investments, both in the technology sector. We bought 17 shares of Alibaba (BABA) and 19 shares of Facebook (FB) and have made a profit of around 200 dollars on them. This seems relatively low considering we have 100,000 dollars to invest, but it's only because we haven't invested too much (having only invested around 10,000 dollars). In the future, once we have fully invested our money, we will definitely be seeing big gains.
