Today was our first official meeting for the charitable investments club. There had been a few meetings prior to this one, but this was the meeting that we decided would be the first official one in our club history. During the meeting, we discussed many important topics like how to move the club forward, but more importantly, what was going on in the world at the time. We all talked about the death of Kobe Bryant and about how coronavirus was ravaging China. Knowing about these events, we tried to research and find stocks that could be good for future investments. Once all of this research was done, each club member gave a 2-3 minute presentation on their chosen stock. After each presentation, we all discussed the viability of the stock that was put forth and made sure to record our thoughts and the stock ticker in a Google Sheets, which would help in organizing the club.  All in all, today was a good day for the club, but it is just the beginning.
