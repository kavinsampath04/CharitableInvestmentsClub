It's been a short time since we had an official meeting, but we have been busy all the same. Just this last weekend (Sunday), we taught Unit 2 or our curriculum, and I am pleased to say that it was a success. The topics we covered are difficult, but we are confident that every club member will be able to understand them, especially after they get some practice. 

As for today, we discussed how we are going to donate the peanut butter that we got recently. At present, we have around 200 pounds of peanut butter that we are going to donate to the North Texas Food Bank (NTFB). Today we agreed that we would make our move this Saturday at 10 a.m. We will notify them before, and we will try to make it a big event. If what we do on Saturday gets into the local newspaper or gets any publicity whatsoever, it will be good news for the club. 

Another item on our itinerary was the potential registration for the Wharton business competition. We see this as an opportunity to expand our investment skills and to just have some fun. However, we will need an educator to be our advisor and register us for the competition. For this very important task, we have selected Mr. Simpson to be our advisor. We don't know if he will, but an email was sent out to him inquiring about his potential participation. All in all, we as a club once again have a course of action.
